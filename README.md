# POZE
POZE is a design project my teammate and I worked on during my 1st year of Masters at the TU/e. The project lasted 6 months and was aimed at creating something for the Effenaar to connect or engage their audience. The project was awarded a grade of "Excellent" and went on for another 6 months showing at Plugged festival, Night of the Nerds, and the Hitszone party at the Effenaar.
