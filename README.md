# POZE
POZE is a design project my teammate (Luuk Roelofs) and I worked on during my 1st year of Masters at the TU/e. The project lasted 12 months and was aimed at creating a digital intervention for the Effenaar to connect or engage their audience. The project was awarded a grade of "Excellent" and was displayed at Plugged festival, Night of the Nerds, and the Hitszone party at the Effenaar.

POZE is an interactive, natural interface game which makes use of a sensor called Kinect and software programmed in Processing3 (a graphical library and IDE built for the electronic arts, new media art, and visual design communities). With the helps of the KInectV2 library, the code identifies the joints of the people who stand in front of the sensor. The game identifies collision between the bodies of the players with graphics on the screen and navigates through levels based on that. 
Being the more technical one in the team, the code has been written by me, and the logic behind it was thought out in collaboration with my teammate. 
The graphics have been coded from scratch in 2D and the use of the KinectV2 lirbary was made.
