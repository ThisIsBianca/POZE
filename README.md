# POZE
POZE is a design project my teammate (Luuk Roelofs) and I worked on during my 1st year of Masters at the TU/e. The project lasted 6 months and was aimed at creating something for the Effenaar to connect or engage their audience. The project was awarded a grade of "Excellent" and went on for another 6 months showing at Plugged festival, Night of the Nerds, and the Hitszone party at the Effenaar.

POZE is an interactive, natural interface game which makes use of a powerful sensor called Kinect and software programmed in Processing3. 
Being the more technical one in the team, the code has been written by me, and the logic behind it was thought out in collaboration with my teammate.
